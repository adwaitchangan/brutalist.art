# Using voiceover audio in a Remotion composition

In this toolkit, narration MP3s are generated **before** Remotion renders, by
`runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py` (Kokoro TTS — free, local). The
Remotion component reads the pre-generated files via `staticFile()` and uses
[`calculateMetadata`](./calculate-metadata) to size the composition to the
measured audio durations.

Never generate audio inside the Remotion render — audio is the master clock and
must be locked before rendering begins.

## Prerequisite: generate and measure audio first

```bash
python3 runtime/scripts/generate_audio_kokoro.py <reel>
```

This writes `audio/beat-<BID>.mp3` and `audio/timings.json` (measured durations
in seconds) into the reel folder. The pipeline reads `timings.json` for every
`actual_duration_s` field in the beat sheet.

## Dynamic composition duration with calculateMetadata

Use [`calculateMetadata`](./calculate-metadata.md) to read the measured
durations and set the composition length accordingly.

```tsx
import { CalculateMetadataFunction, staticFile } from "remotion";
import { getAudioDuration } from "./get-audio-duration";

const FPS = 30;

const SCENE_AUDIO_FILES = [
  "audio/beat-B00.mp3",
  "audio/beat-B01.mp3",
  "audio/beat-B02.mp3",
];

export const calculateMetadata: CalculateMetadataFunction<Props> = async ({
  props,
}) => {
  const durations = await Promise.all(
    SCENE_AUDIO_FILES.map((file) => getAudioDuration(staticFile(file))),
  );

  const sceneDurations = durations.map((durationInSeconds) => {
    return durationInSeconds * FPS;
  });

  return {
    durationInFrames: Math.ceil(sceneDurations.reduce((sum, d) => sum + d, 0)),
  };
};
```

The computed `sceneDurations` are passed into the component via a `voiceover`
prop so the component knows how long each scene should be.

If the composition uses [`<TransitionSeries>`](./transitions.md), subtract the
overlap from total duration: [./transitions.md#calculating-total-composition-duration](./transitions.md#calculating-total-composition-duration)

## Rendering audio in the component

See [audio.md](./audio.md) for more information on how to render audio in the
component.

## Delaying audio start

See [audio.md#delaying](./audio.md#delaying) for more information on how to
delay the audio start.
