# Every other check in ./setup verifies a dependency in isolation (imports,
# ffmpeg on PATH, one synthesized phrase). None of them proves the actual
# pipeline — generate_audio_kokoro.py -> run.sh -> compile.py -- produces a
# watchable video. This script does: it builds the tiny fixture reel at
# examples/_smoke/ all the way to a compiled slate cut, in a throwaway copy
# so repeated runs never dirty the tracked fixture, then verifies the result
# from the DECODED OUTPUT of the mp4 that actually landed on disk:
#
#   GATE AUDIO  ffmpeg volumedetect on the compiled mp4's own audio track,
#               mean_volume > -40 dB (same floor as setup_smoke_kokoro.py)
#   GATE TYPE   ffprobe shows a real video stream + a real audio stream
#   GATE SIZE   the mp4 exists and is not a truncated/empty file
#
# FAILS LOUDLY: any broken step prints why and this script exits non-zero.
# A green "SMOKE PASS" means a render actually happened, not that a command
# returned 0.
